Using pyqt to perform realtime style-transfer

Just run Main.py  

Note that default camera-id is 0  

There are two functions  
the first one is implemented from **CYCLE-GAN model**, doing style transfer from **photo -> paintint**  

the second one is based on **opencv**, doing style transfer from **photo -> comics**
