Using pyqt to perform realtime style-transfer

Just run Main.py  

Note that default camera-id is 0  

There are two functions, the example is shown below. Since the image from carema might show my personal stuff, I choose to show the picture processed by the same algorithms as implemented in this real-time-system.  

the first one is implemented from **CYCLE-GAN model**, doing style transfer from **photo -> paintint**  
<img src="/example_img/2.jpg" width = "500" height = "500" alt="" align=center />         <img src="/example_img/22.jpg" width = "500" height = "500" alt="" align=center />  
the second one is based on **opencv**, doing style transfer from **photo -> comics**  
<img src="/example_img/1.jpg" width = "500" height = "500" alt="" align=center />         <img src="/example_img/11.jpg" width = "500" height = "500" alt="" align=center />
